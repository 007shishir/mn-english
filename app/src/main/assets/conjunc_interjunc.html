    <h1>Conjunctions and Interjections</h1>
    <div class="">
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong><em>conjunction</em></strong>&nbsp;is a word that connects phrases, words, or clauses. Conjunctions are often used as transitions. An&nbsp;<strong><em>interjection</em></strong>&nbsp;is an exclamatory word (or words) that shows strong or sudden feeling and has no grammatical function in the construction of a sentence, such as "Ah ha!".</p>
        <h2>CONJUNCTIONS</h2>
        <p>A conjunction is a word that connects phrases, words, or clauses. Conjunctions are often used as transitions. There are two kinds of conjunctions: Coordinating and Subordinating.</p>
        <h3>COORDINATING: connects words, phrases, or clauses</h3>
        <p><strong><em>and, but, or, for</em></strong></p>
        <p>Gallaudet teachers communicate in American Sign Language&nbsp;<em><strong>and</strong></em>&nbsp;English.</p>
        <p><strong><em>either... or; neither... nor; both... and; not only... but also</em></strong></p>
        <p>Most students use&nbsp;<strong><em>either</em></strong>&nbsp;ASL&nbsp;<em><strong>or&nbsp;</strong></em>English.</p>
        <p><strong><em>hence, therefore, moreover, however, besides, consequently</em></strong></p>
        <p>I like to read;&nbsp;<em><strong>however</strong>,&nbsp;</em>I hate to write.</p>
        <h3>SUBORDINATING: introduces subordinate clauses and connects them with the main clause</h3>
        <p><em><strong>who, which, that</strong></em></p>
        <p>People&nbsp;<em><strong>who</strong></em>&nbsp;live in glass houses don't like children to play catch in front of their houses.</p>
        <p><em><strong>although, because, since, through, if, as if</strong></em></p>
        <p><em><strong>Although</strong></em>&nbsp;I work hard, I'm still broke.</p>
        <h2>INTERJECTIONS</h2>
        <p>An&nbsp;<strong>interjection</strong>&nbsp;is an exclamatory word (or words) that shows weak, mild, or strong feeling and has no grammatical function in the construction of a sentence.</p>
        <p>The table below shows some interjections with examples.</p>
