    <p>An&nbsp;<strong>adverb</strong>&nbsp;is a word/a set of words that modifies&nbsp;verbs,&nbsp;adjectives, and other adverbs. It tells when, where, and how an action is performed or indicates the quality or degree of the action.</p>
    <p>Many adverbs end in -<em>ly</em>&nbsp;but some words which end in -<em>ly</em>&nbsp;(such as&nbsp;<em>friendly</em>) are not adverbs. Many words can be both adverbs and adjectives according to their activity in the sentence.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Robin is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span>&nbsp;hungry for success.</li>

        <li>He wrote that&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">willingly</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Adverb Clauses</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Adverb Phrases</strong>&nbsp;are clauses and phrases that modify the verbs, adjectives or other adverbs in the sentence.</p>
