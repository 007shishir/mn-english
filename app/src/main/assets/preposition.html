        <h2>What is a preposition?</h2>
        <p class="lead"><strong>A preposition is a word used to link&nbsp;</strong><strong>nouns</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>pronouns</strong><strong>, or phrases to other words within a sentence.&nbsp;</strong>They act to connect the people, objects, time and locations of a sentence.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Prepositions are usually short words, and they are normally placed directly in front of nouns. In some cases, you&rsquo;ll find prepositions in front of&nbsp;</strong><strong>gerund verbs</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
        <p>A nice way to think about prepositions is as the words that help glue a sentence together. They do this by expressing position and movement, possession, time and how an action is completed.</p>
        <p>Indeed, several of the most frequently used words in all of English, such as&nbsp;<em>of, to, for, with, on</em>&nbsp;and at, are prepositions. Explaining prepositions can seem complicated, but they are a common part of language and most of us use them naturally without even thinking about it.</p>
        <p>In fact, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that prepositions are regarded as a &lsquo;closed class&rsquo; of words in the English language. This means, unlike verbs and nouns, no new words are added to this group over time. In a way, it reflects their role as the functional workhorse of the sentence. They are unassuming and subtle, yet vitally important to the meaning of language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are two very important rules to remember when using prepositions. Because they are somewhat vague, learning about prepositions and using them correctly in sentences takes practice. Because 1:1 translation is often impossible when dealing with propositions, even the most advanced English students have some difficulty at first.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first rule is that to make sentences clear, specific prepositions are needed. For example, the preposition&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;means one thing and the preposition&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;cannot substitute for it in all cases. Some prepositions are interchangeable but not always. The correct preposition means one particular thing and using a different proposition will give the sentence a very different meaning.&nbsp;<em>I want to see you&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the house now, Bill!</em>&nbsp;means something very different from&nbsp;<em>I want to see you&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;the house now, Bill!</em>&nbsp;<strong><em>In</em></strong><em>&nbsp;the house</em>&nbsp;means Bill should go through the door, walk inside, and stand in the hall or living room.&nbsp;<strong><em>On</em></strong><em>&nbsp;the house</em>&nbsp;means Bill would need to get a ladder and climb to the roof where he would be&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;the house.</li>
            <li>The second rule for using prepositions is that prepositions are generally followed by nouns or pronouns. There was a time in the past when teachers held strictly to this rule, but it made for some clunky sentences.&nbsp;<em>I am seeking someone I can depend on</em>&nbsp;ends with the preposition&nbsp;<em>on</em>, so people who insisted that sentences shouldn&rsquo;t end with a preposition would be forced to use convoluted and unnatural phrasing. To avoid ending that sentence above with a preposition, you&rsquo;d have to say,&nbsp;<em>someone I can depend on is whom I am seeking.</em></li>
            <li>There are more than 100 prepositions in the English language. In addition, there are endless possibilities for creating prepositional<strong>&nbsp;phrases</strong><strong><u>,</u></strong>&nbsp;phrases that begin with a preposition and end with a noun or pronoun. &nbsp;In the following sections, you will find examples of prepositions, types of prepositions, a comprehensive list of prepositions, and some helpful preposition exercises. As you read the examples and study the list, remember that prepositions usually convey concepts such as comparison, direction, place, purpose, source possession, and time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples of Prepositions</h2>
        <p>In the following sentences, examples of prepositions have been italicized. As you read, consider how using different prepositions or even different types of prepositions in place of the examples might change the relationship between the rest of the words in the sentence.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I prefer to read&nbsp;<strong><em>in&nbsp;</em></strong>the library.</li>
            <li>He climbed&nbsp;<strong><em>up</em></strong>&nbsp;the ladder to get&nbsp;<em>onto</em>&nbsp;the roof.</li>
            <li>Please sign your name&nbsp;<strong><em>on</em></strong>&nbsp;the dotted line&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;you read the contract.</li>
            <li>Go&nbsp;<strong><em>down</em></strong>&nbsp;the stairs and&nbsp;<em>through</em>&nbsp;the door.</li>
            <li>He swam&nbsp;<strong><em>across</em></strong>&nbsp;the pool.</li>
            <li>Take your brother&nbsp;<em><strong>with</strong>&nbsp;</em>you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Prepositions</h2>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB">There are three types of prepositions, including time prepositions, place prepositions, and direction prepositions.<br /></span><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Time prepositions</strong></span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;are those such as&nbsp;<em>before, after, during,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>until;&nbsp;</em></span><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>place prepositions</strong></span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;are those indicating position, such as&nbsp;<em>around, between,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>against;&nbsp;</em>and direction prepositions are those indicative of direction, such as&nbsp;<em>across, up,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>down.</em>&nbsp;Each type of preposition is important.</span></p>
        <h2>Type of Prepositions</h2>
        <p><strong>Prepositions of Time<br /></strong>Basic examples of time prepositions include:&nbsp;<em>at, on, in, before</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>after</em>. They are used to help indicate when something happened, happens or will happen. It can get a little confusing though, as many different prepositions can be used.</p>
        <p>Prepositions of time examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1982.</li>
            <li>I was born&nbsp;<strong>in&nbsp;</strong>1982.</li>
            <li>I was born&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>exactly 2am.</li>
            <li>I was born two minutes&nbsp;<strong>before&nbsp;</strong>my twin brother.</li>
            <li>I was born&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the Great War ended.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above makes it seem quite difficult, with five different prepositions used to indicate when something happened. However, there is a set of guidelines that can help decide which preposition to use:</p>
        <p>For years, months, seasons, centuries and times of day, use the preposition&nbsp;<strong><em>in</em></strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I first met John&nbsp;<strong>in&nbsp;</strong>1987.</li>
            <li>It&rsquo;s always cold&nbsp;<strong>in&nbsp;</strong>January</li>
            <li>Easter falls&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;spring each year.</li>
            <li>The Second World War occurred&nbsp;<strong>in&nbsp;</strong>the 20th century.</li>
            <li>We eat breakfast&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the morning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For days, dates and specific holiday days, use the preposition&nbsp;<strong><em>on</em></strong>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We go to school&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;Mondays, but not&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>Sunday</li>
            <li>Christmas is&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>December 25<sup>th</sup>.</li>
            <li>Buy me a present&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;my birthday.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For times, indicators of exception and festivals, use the preposition&nbsp;<strong><em>at</em></strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Families often argue&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>Christmas time.</li>
            <li>I work faster&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>night.</li>
            <li>Her shift finished&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>7pm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Before</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>after</em></strong>&nbsp;should be much easier to understand than the other examples of prepositions of time. Both are used to explain when something happened, happens or will happen, but specifically in relation to another thing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before&nbsp;</strong>I discovered this bar, I used to go straight home&nbsp;<strong>after&nbsp;</strong>work.</li>
            <li>We will not leave&nbsp;<strong>before&nbsp;</strong>3pm.</li>
            <li>David comes&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;Bryan in the line, but&nbsp;<strong>after&nbsp;</strong>Louise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other prepositions of time could include:&nbsp;<em>During, about, around, until and throughout.</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The concert will be staged&nbsp;<strong>throughout&nbsp;</strong>the month of May.</li>
            <li>I learned how to ski&nbsp;<strong>during&nbsp;</strong>the holidays.</li>
            <li>He usually arrives&nbsp;<strong>around&nbsp;</strong>3pm.</li>
            <li>It was&nbsp;<strong>about</strong>&nbsp;six in the morning when we made it to bed.</li>
            <li>The store is open&nbsp;<strong>until</strong>&nbsp;midnight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Prepositions of Place<br /></strong></p>
        <p>To confuse matters a bit, the most common prepositions to indicate time &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>on, at, in&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; are also the most common prepositions to indicate position. However, the rules are a little clearer as place prepositions are a more rigid concept than time prepositions.</p>
        <p>Prepositions of place examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cat is&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>the table.</li>
            <li>The dogs are&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the kennel.</li>
            <li>We can meet&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>the crossroads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The guidelines can be broken down as follows:</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong>On</strong>&nbsp;is used when referring to something with a surface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The sculpture hangs&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>the wall.</li>
            <li>The images are&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>the page.</li>
            <li>The specials are&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;the menu, which is&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;the table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In</strong>&nbsp;is used when referring to something that is inside or within confined boundaries. This could be anything, even a country:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jim is&nbsp;<strong>in&nbsp;</strong>France, visiting his aunt&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the hospital.</li>
            <li>The whiskey is&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the jar&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the fridge.</li>
            <li>The girls play&nbsp;<strong>in</strong>&nbsp;the garden.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>At</strong>&nbsp;is used when referring to something at a specific point:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The boys are&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>&nbsp;the entrance&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>&nbsp;the movie theater.</li>
            <li>He stood&nbsp;<strong>at&nbsp;</strong>the bus stop&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>&nbsp;the corner of Water and High streets.</li>
            <li>We will meet&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>&nbsp;the airport.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Lot&rsquo;s of other prepositions of place, such as&nbsp;<em>under, over, inside, outside, above&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;below</em>&nbsp;are used in English. There is, however, a lot less confusion as they refer to rigid positions rather than abstract ones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The cat is&nbsp;<strong>under</strong>&nbsp;the table.</li>
            <li>Put the sandwich&nbsp;<strong>over&nbsp;</strong>there.</li>
            <li>The key is locked&nbsp;<strong>inside</strong>&nbsp;the car.</li>
            <li>They stepped&nbsp;<strong>outside</strong>&nbsp;the house.</li>
            <li>Major is ranked&nbsp;<strong>above&nbsp;</strong>corporal.</li>
            <li>He is waving at you from&nbsp;<strong>below&nbsp;</strong>the stairs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Prepositions of Movement</strong></p>
        <p>Prepositions of movement are quite easy to understand as they are less abstract than prepositions of place and time. Essentially, they describe how something or someone moves from one place to another. The most commonly used preposition of movement is&nbsp;<strong><em>to</em></strong>, which usually serves to highlight that there is movement towards a specific destination.</p>
        <p>Prepositions of movement examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He has gone on vacation&nbsp;<strong>to&nbsp;</strong>France.</li>
            <li>She went&nbsp;<strong>to</strong>&nbsp;the bowling alley every Friday last summer.</li>
            <li>I will go&nbsp;<strong>to</strong>&nbsp;bed when I am tired.</li>
            <li>They will go&nbsp;<strong>to&nbsp;</strong>the zoo if they finish their errands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other more specific prepositions of movement include:&nbsp;<em>through, across, off, down</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>into</em>. These prepositions can sometimes get mixed up with others. While they are similar, they have individual meanings that add context to the movement.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Across</em></strong>&nbsp;refers to moving from one side to another.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mike traveled&nbsp;<strong>across</strong>&nbsp;America on his motorcycle.</li>
            <li>Rebecca and Judi are swimming&nbsp;<strong>across</strong>&nbsp;the lake.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Through</em></strong>&nbsp;refers to moving directly inside something and out the other end.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bullet Ben shot went&nbsp;<strong>through&nbsp;</strong>the window.</li>
            <li>The train passes&nbsp;<strong>through</strong>&nbsp;the tunnel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Into</em></strong>&nbsp;refers to entering or looking inside something.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>James went<strong>&nbsp;into&nbsp;</strong>the room<strong>.</strong></li>
            <li>They stare&nbsp;<strong>into</strong>&nbsp;the darkness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>Up, over, down, past</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>around</em>&nbsp;</strong>indicate directions of movement:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jack went&nbsp;<strong>up</strong>&nbsp;the hill.</li>
            <li>Jill came tumbling&nbsp;<strong>down&nbsp;</strong>after.</li>
            <li>We will travel&nbsp;<strong>over</strong>&nbsp;rough terrain on our way to Grandma&rsquo;s house.</li>
            <li>The horse runs&nbsp;<strong>around</strong>&nbsp;the track all morning.</li>
            <li>A car zoomed&nbsp;<strong>past</strong>&nbsp;a truck on the highway</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How to Recognize a Preposition?</strong></p>
        <p>Recognizing prepositions can be challenging as they do not always follow a consistent pattern in terms of their position in a sentence, nor do they have a discernible structure or spelling. We do know, however, that prepositions are almost always short words, with the majority having less than six letters. One technique people use to identify a preposition is to think of a preposition as&nbsp;<strong><em>anywhere a mouse can go</em></strong>.&nbsp;<em>Above, below, next to, between, beyond, through, by, with</em>&hellip;It won&rsquo;t cover them all, but it can be a useful question to ask when trying to identify and recognize a preposition. While there are over 100 prepositions, there are around 500,00-700,000 nouns in English! It is unlikely anyone will learn so many nouns, but recognizing and then mastering prepositions might be a worthwhile and attainable goal.</p>
        <p><strong>Prepositions with Nouns</strong></p>
        <p>There are lots of different nouns that carry specific prepositions to consolidate their meaning. These are called dependent prepositions. Again, there isn&rsquo;t a set rule that says a particular type of noun will take a dependent preposition, although they normally follow the noun. Moreover, there are many possible combinations. Essentially, it&rsquo;s case of familiarizing yourself with the different possibilities of nouns and dependent prepositions. Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He displayed&nbsp;<strong>cruelty</strong>&nbsp;<strong>towards</strong>&nbsp;his dog.</li>
            <li>She had&nbsp;<strong>knowledge</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of&nbsp;</strong>physics.</li>
            <li>The&nbsp;<strong>trouble</strong>&nbsp;<strong>with&nbsp;</strong>Jack.</li>
            <li>21 is the&nbsp;<strong>age at</strong>&nbsp;which you are allowed to drink.</li>
            <li>Bolt made another&nbsp;<strong>attempt at</strong>&nbsp;the world record.</li>
            <li>The police held an&nbsp;<strong>inquiry into</strong>&nbsp;the murder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Prepositions with Verbs</strong></p>
        <p>Prepositional verbs &ndash; the phrasal combinations of verbs and prepositions &ndash; are important parts of speech. The prepositions again act as links between the verb and noun or gerund, giving extra meaning to the sentence. The prepositions most commonly used with verbs are:&nbsp;<em>to, for, about, of, in, at</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>from</em>. The good news is that these will always come after the verb in the sentence. However, it should also be noted that the prepositional verbs can have slightly different meaning compared to the original verb. For example,&nbsp;<em>to relate a story</em>&nbsp;simply means to tell a story, to relate&nbsp;<strong>to</strong>&nbsp;a story means you identify with it, find some personally meaning in that story.</p>
        <p>Verb + to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He&nbsp;<strong>admitted to&nbsp;</strong>the charge.</li>
            <li>I&nbsp;<strong>go to</strong>&nbsp;Vancouver on vacation twice a year.</li>
            <li>William can&nbsp;<strong>relate to</strong>&nbsp;the character in the play.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He must&nbsp;<strong>apologize for</strong>&nbsp;his actions.</li>
            <li>We&nbsp;<strong>searched for</strong>&nbsp;ages before we found the perfect apartment.</li>
            <li>I&nbsp;<strong>provide for</strong>&nbsp;my family by working two jobs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<strong>agree with</strong>&nbsp;your claim.</li>
            <li>The lawyer said he will&nbsp;<strong>meet with</strong>&nbsp;your representatives.</li>
            <li>They&nbsp;<strong>began with</strong>&nbsp;a quick warm-up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I&nbsp;<strong>dream of</strong>&nbsp;a better life.</li>
            <li>Have you&nbsp;<strong>heard of</strong>&nbsp;Shakespeare?</li>
            <li>The bread&nbsp;<strong>consists of</strong>&nbsp;dough, raisins and a little honey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does Rick&nbsp;<strong>believe in</strong>&nbsp;miracles?</li>
            <li>Fallon&nbsp;<strong>lives in</strong>&nbsp;New York.</li>
            <li>The bus accident&nbsp;<strong>resulted in</strong>&nbsp;my being late to work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + at</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We&nbsp;<strong>arrived at</strong>&nbsp;our destination.</li>
            <li>Ilene&nbsp;<strong>excels at&nbsp;</strong>singing.</li>
            <li>Will the baby&nbsp;<strong>smile at&nbsp;</strong>her mother?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Verb + on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We should really<strong>&nbsp;concentrate on</strong>&nbsp;our studies now.</li>
            <li>Helen&nbsp;<strong>insisted on</strong>&nbsp;Brenda&rsquo;s company.</li>
            <li>Morris&nbsp;<strong>experimented on</strong>&nbsp;some canvas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verb + from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since turning 80, she&nbsp;<strong>suffers from</strong>&nbsp;lapses in concentration.</li>
            <li>Dad&nbsp;<strong>retired from</strong>&nbsp;the navy in the 1970s.</li>
            <li>Billy Bob, please&nbsp;<strong>refrain from</strong>&nbsp;doing that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Prepositions with Adjectives</strong></p>
        <p>Prepositions can form phrases with adjectives to give further context to the action, emotion or thing the adjective is describing. Like verbs and nouns, adjectives can be followed by:&nbsp;<strong><em>to, about, In, for, with, at</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>by</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am happily&nbsp;<strong>married to&nbsp;</strong>David.</li>
            <li>Ellie is&nbsp;<strong>crazy about</strong>&nbsp;this movie.</li>
            <li>Michelle is&nbsp;<strong>interested in&nbsp;</strong>politics.</li>
            <li>We are&nbsp;<strong>sorry for</strong>&nbsp;your loss.</li>
            <li>Jane will be&nbsp;<strong>delighted with</strong>&nbsp;her results.</li>
            <li>Is he still&nbsp;<strong>angry at</strong>&nbsp;the world?</li>
            <li>The entire room was&nbsp;<strong>astonished by</strong>&nbsp;the election results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There can sometimes be a pattern in deciding which prepositions go with adjectives, for example, when adjectives have the same or very similar meaning to each other, they might take the same preposition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frightened&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>, afraid&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>, scared&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>, terrified&nbsp;<strong>of</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Indeed, when adjectives have opposite meaning they might also take the same preposition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Good&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>, great&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>, superb&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>, wonderful&nbsp;<strong>at</strong></li>
            <li>Bad&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>, terrible&nbsp;<strong>at</strong>, woeful<strong>&nbsp;at</strong>, inept&nbsp;<strong>at</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are always many exceptions to the above, but it can help that there seems to be some</p>
        <p>consistency when adjectives have the same meaning or opposite meaning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, perhaps a more general rule is that English speakers simply need to learn which prepositions go with which adjectives, as meaning can change significantly by using a different preposition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>I am&nbsp;<strong>good at</strong>&nbsp;sports</em>&nbsp;means I have some athletic talent.</li>
            <li><em>The nurse was&nbsp;<strong>good to</strong>&nbsp;my mother&nbsp;</em>means she took care of her and was nice, kind, and helpful.</li>
            <li><em>I am&nbsp;<strong>good with</strong>&nbsp;animals</em>&nbsp;means I get along with them and handle them well.</li>
            <li><em>Swimming is&nbsp;<strong>good for</strong>&nbsp;your health.</em></li>
            <li><em>That was&nbsp;<strong>good of</strong>&nbsp;you to come</em>&nbsp;means you were begin nice and good to visit.</li>
            <li><em>My little brother is&nbsp;<strong>good inside&nbsp;</strong>(his body)&nbsp;</em>means even though you can&rsquo;t see how he thinks and feels, he is good. Even if his behavior is bad.</li>
            <li><em>The blueberry jam will be&nbsp;<strong>good on&nbsp;</strong>toast.&nbsp;</em></li>
        </ul>
