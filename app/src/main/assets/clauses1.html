<h3 style="text-align: center;">CLAUSE AND ITS TYPES</h3>
<p><strong>Clause</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A clause is a group of related words containing a subject and a predicate&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p>For example,<em>&nbsp;he laughed.</em></p>
<p>A clause refers to a group of related words (within a sentence&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>itself
    as an independent sentence) which has both subject and predicate.&nbsp;<br/><strong><br/>Example</strong><br/><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        I will meet him&nbsp;</strong>in the office.<br/><br/>The part of the above sentence &ldquo;I
    will meet him&rdquo; is a clause because it has a subject(I) and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a
    predicate(will meet him). On the other hand, the rest part of the above sentence &ldquo;in
    office&rdquo; lacks both subject and predicate(verb) such group of word is called phrase.</p>
<p>A clause may stand as a simple sentence or may join another clause to make a sentence. Therefore,
    a sentence consists of one, two or more clauses.</p>
<p><strong>Examples.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><u>He is sleeping</u>.&nbsp;(one clause)</li>
    <li><u>The kids were laughing</u>&nbsp;at the joker. (one clause)</li>
    <li><u>The teacher asked a question</u>,&nbsp;<u>but no one answered</u>. (two clauses)</li>
    <li><u>I am happy</u>,&nbsp;<u>because I won a prize</u>. (two clauses)</li>
    <li><u>I like Mathematics</u>,&nbsp;<u>but my brother likes Biology</u><span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><u>because he wants to become a
        doctor</u>. (three clauses)
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Types of Clauses</h1>
<p>There are two major types of clauses&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>main (or independent) clause</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>subordinate (or dependent) clause</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Main Clause and Subordinate Clause &ndash; Comparison</strong></p>
<p>He is buying a shirt which looks very nice.&nbsp;<br/>The above sentence has two clauses &ldquo;He
    is buying a shirt&rdquo; and &ldquo;which looks very nice&rdquo;. The clause &ldquo;He is buying
    a shirt&rdquo; expresses a complete thought and can alone stand as a sentence. Such a clause is
    called a&nbsp;<strong>main or independent clause.</strong><br/><br/>While the clause &ldquo;which
    looks very nice&rdquo; does not express a complete thought and can&rsquo;t stand as a sentence.
    It depends on another clause (main clause) to express a complete idea. Such a clause is called a&nbsp;<strong>subordinate
        or dependent clause.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Main or Independent Clause&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Main (or independent) clause is a clause that expresses a complete thought and can stand
    as a sentence.</p>
<p><br/>Examples</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>I met the boy</u>&nbsp;who had helped me.</li>
    <li><u>She is wearing a shirt</u>&nbsp;which looks nice.</li>
    <li><u>The teacher asked a question</u>&nbsp;but no one answered.</li>
    <li><u>He takes medicine</u>&nbsp;because he suffers from fever.</li>
    <li><u>He became angry</u>&nbsp;and smashed the vase into pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In the above sentences, each underlined part shows the main clause. It expresses complete
    though and can stand as a sentence that is why a main or an independent clause is normally
    referred to as a simple sentence.</p>
<h2><strong>Subordinate or dependent Clause</strong></h2>
<p>Subordinate (or independent) clause is a clause which does not express a complete thought and
    depends on another clause (main clause) to express a complete thought. The subordinate clause
    does not express a complete idea and can&rsquo;t stand as a sentence. A sentence having a
    subordinate clause must have a main clause.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br/>Example</p>
<p>He likes Chinese rice&nbsp;<u>which tastes good</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br/>The clause &ldquo;which tastes good&rdquo; in the above sentence is a subordinate clause
    because it does not express a complete thought and can&rsquo;t stand as a sentence. It depends
    on the main clause (he likes Chinese rise) to express a complete thought.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Examples.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>I met the boy&nbsp;<u>who had helped me</u>.</li>
    <li>I bought a table&nbsp;<u>that costs $ 100</u>.</li>
    <li>He takes medicine&nbsp;<u>because he suffers from fever.</u></li>
    <li>The teacher asked a question&nbsp;<u>but no one answered.</u></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Subordinate (or dependent) clauses are further divided into three types,&nbsp;<br/>1. Noun
    Phrase, 2. Adjective Phrase, 3. Adverb Phrase&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Types of Subordinate Clause</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Functions of Subordinate Clause.</strong></h3>
<p>A subordinate (dependent) clause may function as a noun, an adjective or an adverb in a sentence.
    On the basis of their function in a sentence, subordinate clauses can be divided into following
    types.</p>
<p><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Noun Clause<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Adjective Clause.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
    Adverb Clause</p>
<h2><strong>Noun Clause</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;</strong>A dependent clause that functions as a noun in a sentence is
    called noun clause.&rdquo;<br/>A noun clause performs same function like a noun in a sentence.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Example
</p>
<p><strong>What he did</strong>&nbsp;made a problem for his family.<br/><br/>In the above sentence
    the clause &ldquo;what he did&rdquo; functions as a noun, hence it is a noun clause. A noun
    clause works as a noun that acts as a subject, object, or predicate in a sentence. A noun clause
    starts with words&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;that, what, whatever, who, whom, whoever, whomever&rdquo;</em>.
</p>
<p><br/>Examples</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Whatever you learn</strong>&nbsp;will help you in future. (noun clause as a subject)
    </li>
    <li><strong>What you said</strong>&nbsp;made me laugh.&nbsp; (noun clause as a subject)</li>
    <li>He knows&nbsp;<strong>that he will pass the test.&nbsp;</strong>(noun clause as an object)
    </li>
    <li>Now I realize&nbsp;<strong>what he would have thought.&nbsp;</strong>(noun clause as an
        object)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Adjective Clause</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;</strong>A dependent clause that functions as
    an adjective in a sentence is called adjective clause.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br/>An
    adjective clause works like an adjective in a sentence. The function of an adjective is to
    modify (describe) a noun or a pronoun. Similarly, a noun clause modifies a noun or a
    pronoun.<br/><br/>Example</p>
<p><br/>He wears a shirt&nbsp;<strong>which looks nice</strong>.<br/><br/>The clause &ldquo;which
    looks nice&rdquo; in the above sentence is an adjective clause because it modifies the noun
    &ldquo;shirt&rdquo; in the sentence.&nbsp;<br/>An adjective clause always precedes the noun it
    modifies.<br/><strong><br/>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>I met the boy&nbsp;<strong>who had helped me</strong>.</li>
    <li>An apple&nbsp;<strong>that smells bad</strong>&nbsp;is rotten.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The book&nbsp;<strong>which I like&nbsp;</strong>is helpful in preparation for a test.</li>
    <li>The house&nbsp;<strong>where I live</strong>&nbsp;consists of four rooms.</li>
    <li>The person&nbsp;<strong>who was shouting</strong>&nbsp;needed help.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Adjective clause begins with a&nbsp;<strong>relative pronoun</strong>&nbsp;(that, who, whom,
    whose, which, or whose) and is also a&nbsp;<strong>relative clause</strong>.<br/>Adjective
    (relative) clauses can be a&nbsp;<strong>restrictive clause</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>nonrestrictive
        clause</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses</strong></h2>
<p>Adjective (relative) clauses can be a&nbsp;<strong>restrictive
    clause</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>nonrestrictive clause</strong>.</p>
<p>A restrictive clause limits the meaning of the preceding noun or pronoun. A nonrestrictive clause
    tells us something about the preceding noun or pronoun but does not limit the meaning of the
    preceding noun or pronoun.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
    <li>The student in the class&nbsp;<strong>who studied a lot</strong>&nbsp;passed the test.
        (restrictive clause)
    </li>
    <li>The student in the class,&nbsp;<strong>who had attended all the lectures</strong>, passed
        the test. (nonrestrictive clause)
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In the first sentence the clause &ldquo;who studied a lot&rdquo; restrict information to
    preceding noun(student), it means that there is only one student in the class who studied a lot,
    hence it is a restrictive clause.&nbsp;<br/><br/>In the second sentence the clause &ldquo;who
    had attended all the lectures&rdquo; gives us information about the preceding noun but does not
    limit this information to the preceding noun. It means there can be several other students in
    the class who had attended all the lectures.&nbsp;<br/><br/>A comma is always used before a
    restrictive clause in a sentence and also after a nonrestrictive clause if it is within the main
    clause. &ldquo;That&rdquo; is usually used to introduce a restrictive clause while &ldquo;which&rdquo;
    is used to introduce a nonrestrictive clause.<br/><br/>Example</p>
<ul>
    <li>The table&nbsp;<strong>that costs $ 100</strong>&nbsp;is made of steel. (restrictive clause)
    </li>
    <li>The table,&nbsp;<strong>which costs $ 100</strong>, is made of steel. (nonrestrictive
        clause)
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Adverb Clause</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;</strong>A dependent clause that functions as an adverb in a
    sentence is called the adverb clause&rdquo;<br/>An adverb clause like an adverb modifies a verb,
    adjective clause or other adverb clause in a sentence.&nbsp;<strong>It modifies(describes) the
        situation in main clause in terms of &ldquo;time, frequency (how often), &nbsp;cause and
        effect, contrast, condition, intensity (to what extent)</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br/>The subordinating conjunctions used for adverb clauses are as
    follows.<br/><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;when, whenever, since, until, before, after, while, as,
    by the time, as soon as<br/><strong>Cause and effect:</strong>&nbsp;because, since, now that, as
    long as, so, so that,&nbsp;<br/><strong>Contrast:</strong>&nbsp;although, even, whereas, while,
    though<br/><strong>Condition:</strong>&nbsp;if, unless, only if, whether or not, even if,
    providing or provided that, in case</p>
<p><br/><strong>Examples.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t go<strong>&nbsp;before he comes.</strong></li>
    <li>He takes medicine&nbsp;<strong>because he is ill.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Although he tried a lot,</strong>&nbsp;he couldn&rsquo;t climb up the tree.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unless you study for the test,</strong>&nbsp;you can&rsquo;t pass it.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>I will go to the school&nbsp;<strong>unless it rains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
    </li>
    <li>You are safe&nbsp;<strong>as long as you drive carefully.</strong></li>
    <li>You can achieve anything&nbsp;<strong>provided that you struggle for it.</strong></li>
</ul>
